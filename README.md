This Guide was created for my boot camp prework and it contains notes on HTML, CSS, git and JavaScript. It shows first steps for anyone that would want to get into web developing. I have learned how to create and style a webpage in a simple way and how to use the dev tools (console) to check and debug my JavaScript code.
